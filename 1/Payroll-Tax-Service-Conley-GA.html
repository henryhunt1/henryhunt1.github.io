With Poster, you can reduce your startup costs and switch between payment plans anytime to catch up with your business growth.</p>
<p>Hardware — Many POS systems come with hardware such as cash drawers, tablets, card readers, and ticket printers. Still, for retail businesses that want a straightforward POS system for online and in-person sales, Shopify packs a potent punch.
