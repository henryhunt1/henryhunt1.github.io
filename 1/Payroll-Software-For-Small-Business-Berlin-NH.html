<p>When you open a restaurant, cafe or bar, you need a point-of-sale system to accept credit and debit payments.

The vital purpose of any such system is to keep the business data organized, well-managed and maximize profit and the POS knowledge will help your staff to work efficiently and enhanced productivity.</p>
<p>From desktop to mobile POS to self-service, Intel® processors and technologies power the point of sale and deliver hardware-enhanced security to help encrypt and protect data.
