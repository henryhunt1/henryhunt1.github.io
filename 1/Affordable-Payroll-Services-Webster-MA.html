Even though different types of restaurants have different needs for POS functionality, they all need reliable support and service to keep operations running.</p>

Top-rated restaurant POS systems also offer preset tipping options, built-in distribution, and server payout calculators.</p>

Its POS system is built primarily for restaurants and other food-based businesses, though retail stores can also use it.

<p>Small bars typically benefit from cloud-based POS software offered on a month-to-month basis. Depending on the program, customers can store up points or earn rewards based on the amount of money they spend. But I had breakfast with a group of retailers and I asked them what kind of retail software point of sale (POS) systems they were using.
