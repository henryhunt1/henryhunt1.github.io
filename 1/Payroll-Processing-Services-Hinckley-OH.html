<p>In running a successful business, there are few things more important than money. A point of sale system also can manage inventory levels across multiple business locations, allowing you to centralize your tracking system rather than relying on separate inventory schedules for each location. Tracking inventory accurately is a particularly tough challenge for restaurants and bars because the majority of your products aren't in simple units. The menus are outfitted with desirable features that allow guests to place orders, enter custom cooking specifications, order drinks, request table service, tender secure payment (from the table) and view detailed descriptions of menu items-inclusive of high-resolution images and wine and beer pairing options.</p>
<p>The problem with this is that it's often more expensive and the hardware is probably going to be unusable if you switch POS software.

With a flat and predictable monthly service fee, it's beneficial for merchants who want the lowest TCO (total cost of ownership) of any other full-featured touchscreen point-of-sale systems in the hospitality industry.</p>
