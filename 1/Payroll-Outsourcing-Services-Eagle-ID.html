<p>Choosing a Point of Sale System is not a simple task. Although improving the ergonomics is possible, a clean, fast-paced look may come at the expense of sacrificing functions that are often wanted by end-users such as discounts, access to commission earned screens, membership and loyalty schemes can involve looking at a different function of the POS to ensure the point of sale screen contains only what a cashier needs at their disposal to serve customers.</p>

Most restaurant POS solutions have reporting features built-in to monitor your transactions by date, time, and type. With lack of access to processed business information, retailers earlier operated on demand forecasts based on intuitions and gut feelings.</p>
