These provide retailers with tools ranging from order management and inventory tracking to customer management and payment processing for more seamless transactions.</p>

<p>Increased Employee Customer Interaction: Because POS systems are efficient at reducing the amount of time employees have to spend doing business operation tasks, they will have more time to spend with the customer. Retailers also have certain functionality that should be incorporated in the POS system, spanning from an inventory library to keep track of stock levels to hardware tools like a scale on the counter (for food priced according to weight), barcode scanner and a device for taking off alarm tags of liquor bottles or clothes.</p>
<p>In response, retailers pursuing omnichannel with Retail Pro are turning their technology gains into customer-facing conveniences for unified commerce that puts shoppers first.
