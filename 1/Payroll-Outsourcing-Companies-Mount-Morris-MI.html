<p>When a customer orders food or purchases an item, you accept payment directly through your POS machine. There are countless options for POS software and many software companies advertise as retail management systems,” but while researching, it can be hard to determine what retail POS features are actually included in the software. A POS system is actually a retail management system” since the software goes beyond just processing sales, offering other capabilities such as inventory management, employee management, customer management, a membership system, supplier records, bookkeeping, issuing of purchase orders, quotations and stock transfers, sales reporting, and more.</p>
<p>Perhaps a retail store uses touch technology when they check out a customer at the department store. The business owners only have to download an app and create an account for a mobile POS system. Managing inventory in a retail business is very challenging because the stock is always in flux and the demand of items keeps shifting. The software has become a staple for many small businesses requiring a fully functional POS that does not break the bank.</p>

<p>I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc. This way, you'll have happy customers increase your restaurant's popularity. At the same time, a good POS system will allow you to accept cash, credit, and contactless payments and some will even let you accept online payments for your products and services.</p>
