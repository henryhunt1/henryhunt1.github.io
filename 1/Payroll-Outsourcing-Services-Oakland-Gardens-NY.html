<p>Choosing a POS, or point of sale, system seems as though it would be quite easy. For instance, while a restaurant is typically concerned about how the sale window functions, whether it has functionality such as for creating item buttons, for various discounts, for adding a service charge, for holding of receipts, for queuing, for table service as well as for takeaways, merging and splitting of a receipt, these capabilities may yet be insufficient for a spa or slimming center which would require in addition a scheduling window with historical records of customers' attendance and their special requirements.</p>
<p>Features include inventory management, sales analytics, digital receipts and loyalty programs. Add to that robust multi-location management tools and an amazing array of ready integrations, and you tailor Lightspeed to fit your exact bar service needs. Offer customers the option of leaving a security deposit or partial payment towards items instead of paying all at once. From the console, retailers can create products, check stock, change prices, run sales reports, and more.</p>
<p>Reporting is also a paramount consideration, so when it comes to selecting a retail management software, you'll want customized reporting with detailed customer reporting, sales reports, vendor reporting, and inventory stock levels. POS systems let retailers track their inventory across multiple stores in different locations. The company should have references, provide after-hours technical support, provide warranty protection, assist with incorporating the system in the business, and are up-to-date on software and new features.</p>

<p>Mobile POS systems are gaining popularity in some customer-facing industries. While the chances of a disaster, theft, or malfunction happening to those hard drives seems slim; it has hit businesses at the worst times. Once you've come up with a shortlist of potential POS systems, check out what businesses like yours are saying about them. The OrderUp Self-Order Kiosk app is designed to increase ticket size by at least 20% at table and counter service restaurants.</p>

Through the tablet's interface, customers can pay bills, sign receipts, and even offer tips for convenient cashless and paperless transactions.</p>
<p>Also, you'll need all the features that a quality point of sale system provides to aid in managing your operations and growing your store's customer base. Usually, this is an automated process which is scheduled to run at a certain time interval in real stores. With the Harbortouch Bar & Restaurant table management feature, you can see how many people are at a table, and see which tables are occupied or vacant.</p>
