A point of sale system helps to make everything from inputting orders to inventory and even taking payment more streamlined. Square POS is a point-of-sale software solution with features such as accept credit cards with your iPhone, Android, and iPad along with the flexibility to accept credit card payments anywhere, from Square headquartered in San Francisco, California.</p>
<p>Loyalty and rewards programs will keep customers coming back time after time, and is a feature that retail POS systems can't handle. Square doubles as a credit card processor, so you won't need to integrate a third-party solution to accept payments.

Lightspeed makes it easy to build a customized menu, take and manage guest orders, and facilitate multiple payment methods.</p>

<p>If your business is lean and mean, or if you're episodically using the POS, you'll only pay the processing fee of 2.75% per charge for credit cards (the fee is slightly higher for cash payments). In short, therefore, you can think of the whole thing as a centralized restaurant management system.
