<p>For any restaurant, point of sale technology is important. Retailers can reasonably expect to acquire such systems (including hardware) for about $4000 US (as of 2009) per checkout lane. Sometimes, even after spending a lot of valuable time searching for the best possible system, restaurant owners end up making a mistake by basing their final decision on cost alone.
