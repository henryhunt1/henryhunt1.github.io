But the POS has transformed physical retail, allowing SMBs and large corporations alike to gain new, deep insights into their business. This is why I recommend taking your time and assessing the various people you will rely on to make the software work for your business.

Refunds and store credit can be offered and Shopify allows for pretty much any payment option you can think of.
