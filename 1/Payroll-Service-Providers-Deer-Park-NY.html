<p>It's hard to envision a retail or point of sale (POS) environment that doesn't make use of touch technology. Manhattan Point of Sale is the next generation POS system for retail, helping retailers sell, fulfill, and engage anywhere. Bar menus change all the time, and your point of sale system should adapt to it. Whether you offer happy hour specials or a new food item on your menu, you want a system that can sync all the information. It is used to store Money, credit card receipts and other paperwork. The primary differences between Quick Service and Full Service POS systems can be found in the software and hardware specifications.</p>
<p>If a restaurant operates from more than one location, it can maintain a centralized, POS enabled inventory management system instead of visiting every location in person to supervise. For newer, smaller businesses, you may not need advanced and expensive POS system reporting features. Access the details for every reservation in the calendar to check the date, time, and notes on customers' preferences or their pre-order.</p>
<p>Many a times the users might prefer to make partial payments- some by using Gift card (GC) and remaining by Cash. Plus, never miss a sale again with offline credit card payments. You get to manage your retail business using a unified interface, which means you can instantly accept payments from multiple channels (credit cards, online payments, etc.) without worrying about third-party fees and restrictions and saving you a lot of time.</p>

<p>The solution offers a set of table management features that facilitates coordination between the kitchen and the restaurant floor. One thing to watch out for is that sometimes these features are included in the basic monthly software fee while other times they need to be purchased, upping the price. From cash, credit card, check, debit, on account, Apple Pay, and Google Wallet, accept virtually all forms of payment.</p>

<p>Tracking sales and inventory, renting videos and equipment, creating membership accounts, look ups by category, and managing your store's books are just a few of the features.

The many benefits of point of sale systems make it an essential business investment.</p>
<p>Lightspeed charges 2.6% + 10¢ for payment processing (the same rate as Square for Restaurants) but can also integrate with outside payment processors, which you might prefer to use if you can secure a better rate elsewhere. After ten years, ShopKeep continues offering small, quick service restaurants an easy user interface with great base features. Retailers have the option of using local, server-based POS software, which stores sales data onsite; however, the best programs are either app- or cloud-based SaaS solutions.</p>
