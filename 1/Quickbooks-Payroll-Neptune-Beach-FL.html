<p>The days of conventional cash registers are almost over, as the modern point-of-sale (POS) has grown its popularity in the last few years.

This is because VAT taxpayers may need to provide a certificate to the tax authorities showing that their cash management system fulfills the new requirements.</p>
<p>Again, these exploits by hackers could only be made possible because payment cards were processed through the POS system allowing the malware to either intercept card data during processing or steal and transmit unencrypted card data that is stored in the system database. A POS should have customer relationship management (CRM) to track all customer data. Vend POS checks most of the boxes small businesses are looking for when it comes to a point-of-sale solution.</p>
