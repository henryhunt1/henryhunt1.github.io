A right POS should also keep track of inventory at other branches and provide continuous insights on product sales. As point of sale systems evolved, they became more computerised, storing a product database on a computer server. In addition, you can use them with back-end accounting systems and credit card payment processors Many small to midsize businesses (SMBs) are using these types of cloud-enabled POS services without the need to keep a physical back-end server in multiple locations.</p>
