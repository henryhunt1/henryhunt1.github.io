<p>When it comes to choosing the right Linux POS software for your business it is important that you know what the advantages and disadvantages are to be had from the Linux based ones. But if you've done any online searches for POS systems yourself, you've likely discovered something overwhelming: there's a staggering pile of POS solutions to choose from. In its most basic definition, a POS system is a combination of POS hardware and POS software to create a POS machine for processing a transaction and payment. Catering: Using this restaurant management system, you can manage catering orders for wedding, office parties and other social gatherings.</p>
<p>Features include inventory management, sales analytics, digital receipts and loyalty programs. Add to that robust multi-location management tools and an amazing array of ready integrations, and you tailor Lightspeed to fit your exact bar service needs. Offer customers the option of leaving a security deposit or partial payment towards items instead of paying all at once. From the console, retailers can create products, check stock, change prices, run sales reports, and more.</p>
<p>Touch screen systems designed for restaurants, bars, cafes and anyplace that sales food to customers. This allows you to elevate customer service and improve turnaround time when customer orders are quickly entered front of house and immediately available to back of house for processing. Meanwhile, the Smart Table Management gives you the real-time status of your tables so that you can keep a close tab on orders and payments.</p>

When it comes to your retail inventory system, accurate tracking should be a deciding factor in your retail point of sale decision.</p>
<p>As you can see, some basic hardware and software features are common to both QSR and FSR point of sale systems. Although you should consider your business's unique POS system needs, we think Square offers the best overall package to fit most small businesses, from restaurants to retail shops. Recent research, Retail in 4 Dimensions , shows 60 percent of consumers surveyed want mobile payment options in-store.</p>
