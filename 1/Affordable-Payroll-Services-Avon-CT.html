<p>The time and attendance system is another crucial aspect of managing labor. The Lavu restaurant POS system can proceed with payment processing even in offline mode. But the POS has transformed physical retail, allowing SMBs and large corporations alike to gain new, deep insights into their business. This is why I recommend taking your time and assessing the various people you will rely on to make the software work for your business. Evolving from the bulky, complex cash register system to today's highly-portable, fits-in-your-pocket card readers, accepting payments has never been simpler.</p>
<p>The problem with this is that it's often more expensive and the hardware is probably going to be unusable if you switch POS software. If you plan to stick with the payment-processing service you are currently using, you should look at POS systems that will work with that system (known as integrated processing” because the outside company's payments are incorporated into a POS). With a flat and predictable monthly service fee, it's beneficial for merchants who want the lowest TCO (total cost of ownership) of any other full-featured touchscreen point-of-sale systems in the hospitality industry.</p>
<p>The need for special tax calculations arise when you sell an item in the restaurant where the tax is added onto the sale but the same item in the bar has the tax included. With Zomato Book, you get benefits and features commonly found in the higher prices POS systems. But, taking the time to do your homework on point of sale systems can really pay off.
