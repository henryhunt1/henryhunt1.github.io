<p>Check inventory on the fly, assist customers with purchase decisions, and complete transactions — at the counter or out on the sales floor.

The potential for huge profits, additional sales and repeat customers are the overwhelming reasons to sell gift cards.</p>
<p>Bottom Line: Vend POS is a highly flexible and mobile point-of-sale (POS) system that, while it lacks a few advanced features and charges extra for phone support, is an excellent choice for small businesses. Regardless if you're operating a small shop or a restaurant, you would want automation to be on your side when managing sales transactions. With a good (POS) point of sale system, you'll shape inventory to meet customer needs, and find ways to improve the bottom line.</p>

<p>In short the software makes running the retail store easily and conveniently. Smaller restaurants or food trucks can trim down options to the basics for what small food service needs. We focused our products on two vertical markets; Computer Service & Retail Point of Sales and Restaurant Point of Sales. Some systems offer functionality which is close to that offered by CMS packages; for example, sending emails to customers to thank them for sales, advertise bargains or offer coupons, and offer other loyalty perks.</p>
<p>A point of sale system allows you as a business owner to control your inventory levels in real time. Some POS providers will give you a mobile card reader for free, while others will charge you upwards of $1,000 for a POS hardware bundle. In addition to being significantly less expensive than traditional legacy point of sale systems, the real strength of a cloud based point of sale system is that there are developers all over the world creating software applications for cloud based POS.</p>

<p>Some are rather simple applications; others can manage complex inventory situations and employee time tracking. Now that you've eliminated the restaurant point of sale systems that don't meet your needs you can focus on the top three that have made the cut.

<p>Many times it will have the MSR built in. Many large stores use mechanical keyboards which are rated for higher use than a standard consumer keyboard. Instead of an employee double-checking inventory or reconciling the cash register with the sales, the software performs the action. A cloud-based restaurant POS does both by providing an efficient system to modify menus and prices. Integration with 3rd Party Apps — businesses using POS systems need to make their data available to their ERP and accounting applications.</p>
