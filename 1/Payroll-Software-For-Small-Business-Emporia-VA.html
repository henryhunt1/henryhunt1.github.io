<p>Point of Sale (POS) Systems have now become the business management choice for most retailers when managing their day-to-day business activities. Retail and gaming POS solution that offers employee access controls, inventory tracking, check splitting, and loyalty cards. Our POS terminals speed up your daily operations and enhance your customer service by automatically calculating offers, promotion prices and special prices for loyal customers.
