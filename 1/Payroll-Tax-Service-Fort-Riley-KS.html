<p>From traditional to mobile, HP is reinventing the customer experience with technology solutions that empower employees and engage customers. Point-of-sale software has allowed businesses to create customer profiles that give them the ability to track the most popular products and determine what products they should market based on their customers' shopping preferences.

<p>The need for special tax calculations arise when you sell an item in the restaurant where the tax is added onto the sale but the same item in the bar has the tax included. With Zomato Book, you get benefits and features commonly found in the higher prices POS systems. But, taking the time to do your homework on point of sale systems can really pay off.

<p>If you are operating a business, chances are good that you will need a point-of-sale (POS) system to complete consumer purchase transactions - and bars are no exception. Your software handles much more than the sale aspect of the transaction - retail management software is a more accurate description.
