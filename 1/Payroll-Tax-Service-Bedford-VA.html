<p>A good POS system will log the number and value of the sales you've made, as well as tracking your inventory and letting you know when to restock. Disregarding that fact for the time being, compare a retail store with a POS System to an almost identical store with a standard electronic cash register - there are much differences than first meets the eye. Designed for small, medium, and large businesses, the system can be deployed as an online-based service, on-premise, and mobile point-of-sale solution.</p>
