<p>Now the last thing I want is for this be a shameless promotion of the software we develop. One of the first microprocessor-controlled cash register systems was built by William Brobeck and Associates in 1974, for McDonald's Restaurants 4 It used the Intel 8008 , a very early microprocessor (and forerunner to the Intel 8088 processor used in the original IBM Personal Computer ). Each station in the restaurant had its own device which displayed the entire order for a customer — for example, 2 Vanilla Shake, 1 Large Fries, 3 BigMac — using numeric keys and a button for every menu item.</p>
<p>This user-friendly tool is free and enables businesses to accept and process payments both in-store and even on-the-go, for both iOS or Android gadgets. Generally, if your business has annual sales of $500k or more, you can achieve considerable savings and benefits from a POS system. Depending on the POS vendor and the terms of contract, compared to traditional on-premises POS installation, the software is more likely to be continually updated by the developer with more useful features and better performance in terms of computer resources at the remote server and in terms of lesser bugs and errors.</p>
<p>Touch screen systems designed for restaurants, bars, cafes and anyplace that sales food to customers. This allows you to elevate customer service and improve turnaround time when customer orders are quickly entered front of house and immediately available to back of house for processing. Meanwhile, the Smart Table Management gives you the real-time status of your tables so that you can keep a close tab on orders and payments.</p>

<p>The module provides reports that save you time and enable you to gain the insights you need to make data-driven business decisions. RFID in POS can further allow for charging to a customer's card via smartphone before they leave the store.

<p>A lot of general POS systems bill themselves as suitable for use in a restaurant. While the software powering a restaurant POS is the main element of a POS system, hardware is important as well.
