<p>So, of course, restaurants handled most of their management stuff manually. Business managers need to look at the lifetime cost of the Point of Sale Systems. Retail 4.0 will see retailers integrating their offline and online sales via IoT-enabled POS such that customers can shop online and pick up in the store or vice versa. We build custom software for small business including stock control, retail barcode systems, restaurant point of sale (pos),internet cyber cafes, internet shops, e-commerce websites, online shops , hosting etc.</p>
<p>You want to be sure that your POS system can handle all of these latest emerging systems, but you also need to know if that implementation will hinder or help your Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (aka PCI DSS)-compliance efforts or whether it will please or annoy your customers. While each of those establishments are classified as restaurants, they all have very different demands when it comes to choosing the right POS system for their specific needs.</p>
<p>Lightspeed allows restaurants to easily build and update menus, adjust floor plans in real time and update stock inventory. When the remote server is restored and the cashier switches over to the cloud system, the locally processed sale records are then automatically submitted to the remote system, thus maintaining the integrity of the remote database. In addition, Lightspeed includes tools for inventory management, CRM and data analysis, and we have even developed our own payment processing system: Lightspeed Payments.</p>
<p>The best POS systems combine payment processing, inventory and customer management, payroll and accounting, and other services into powerful POS hardware and software packages.
