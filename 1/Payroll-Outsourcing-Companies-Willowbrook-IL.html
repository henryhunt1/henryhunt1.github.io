<p>Keeping a count all the inventory and in-hand stock across physical stores is complex. The earliest POS systems were nothing more than written receipts, but retailers now prefer electronic POS solutions These streamline the sales process, as well as allowing the merchant to collect valuable sales data.

<p>In addition, your POS system must be able to perform basic functions such as bar code scanning, payroll management, handling of cash and credit card transactions and integrate seamlessly with online shopping cart systems.

Our newest product, POSIM EVO, has revolutionized point of sale technology by making available a cross-platform software suite with touch screen capabilities.

The service will cost you a percentage of your earnings, but there are a few services you can use for free such as Square Point of Sale so long as you are willing to process your payments through them.</p>
<p>But if you're looking for deeper insights into details like profits, labor costs, and historical comparisons, look for retail POS systems that offer advanced real-time reporting. The first one is an online type of system that is connected to a central computer for credit checking and inventory updating. This allows businesses to assess what products are being sold and what products are lagging in sales. For those wanting to do more with their business, Talech POS has great advanced features.</p>

<p>Small businesses should expect to pay somewhere between $40 and $100 per month for a POS system with a single cash register. The software includes register features, vendor and inventory management, reports, and a loyalty program. This allows the owner to keep a close tab on his staff as well as customers.
