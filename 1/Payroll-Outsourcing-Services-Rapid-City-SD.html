<p>Onetap is hospitality point of sale, stock control, customer loyalty, reporting and integrated software using smart technology for restaurants, cafes, bars and more. The POS systems control various activities in the restaurant. By combining the data from your POS and payment processing systems, you gain insights into your best-selling products and which items to push back. While there are several kinds of payment processing solutions available, including credit card readers and various new mobile payment methods, the POS systems we reviewed are full-on cash registers. Reliable bar software should also offer beverage service-specific features, such as being able to transfer tabs and split checks and run customer tabs.</p>
<p>The type of POS features we're talking about here range from inventory tracking and menu planning to payment processing, employee management, customer management, and order management. Not all POS software has this option and Managers will thank you for this. IoT-enabled POS systems will eliminate the need for retailers to manually keep track of inventory, reducing the losses arising from storing excess or inadequate inventory.</p>
<p>System is hosted online, i.e. data are stored on your POS provider's internet servers, enabling you to access it from any computer browser. The software itself requires hardware components like an iPad or tablet for android OS, cash drawers, card readers, bar code scanners, receipt printers, and other add-ons to offer the full point of sale experience. Hence, Inventory systems are designed so that managers can order right product at the right time, in the right quantity from the right vendor and at the right price.</p>

<p>POS systems come with a wide variety of features and add-ons. One thing you should note though- while you comfortable adopt it in a single-location business, TouchBistro's POS system is predominantly ideal for restaurant businesses with multiple locations. However, varying POS locations can give retailers more opportunities to micro-market specific product categories and influence consumers at earlier points in the sales funnel.</p>
<p>All modern POS systems have a frontend interface for the point of sale and a backend (sometimes called ‘backoffice' or ‘dashboard') side for behind-the-scenes analytics and management functions. Therefore restaurant POS may boast a customer friendly menu interface to support this. You can easily accept cash payments as well as use credit cards, debit cards, etc. The companies and businesses get hold of commerce by making use of point of sale systems that helps in promoting longevity in the business.</p>

<p>In addition, your POS system must be able to perform basic functions such as bar code scanning, payroll management, handling of cash and credit card transactions and integrate seamlessly with online shopping cart systems. This is also referred to as a credit card terminal—it's what merchants use to accept credit and debit card payments. With a mobile POS system, on the other hand, they can split the check right at the table and, if there's any confusion as to who ordered what or how the table wants to divide a shared appetizer, the waiter is right there to ask the customers.</p>
<p>Scheduling employees and staying on top of their hours is possible from the POS too, and our POS can be integrated with your payroll management software. Most restaurant owners would agree that it's worth paying a little more each month in order to ensure that: 1) you and your staff can get support when you need it 2) you'll always have the most up-to-date software available. These features can also help manage those customers and page them when work has been completed.</p>
