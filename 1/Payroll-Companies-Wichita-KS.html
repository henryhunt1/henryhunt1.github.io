<p>Bar staff often work without direct supervision and liquor waste and theft is hard to detect or prevent. All types of restaurants and bars match process flow to AccuPOS' adaptive system with touch screen, PC, handheld, and tablet. ShopKeep's inventory management module, while made for retailers, does a great job of managing restaurant inventory. To keep the service and guest experience seamless, you need a nightclub or bar POS system that can keep up with the rush. The POS hardware you need for your bar will typically include a tablet, tablet stand, receipt printer, cash drawer, and credit card terminal or card reader.</p>
<p>With any of these restaurant management systems, a restaurant or any other food-serving establishment is sure to see a marked increase in its efficiency, productivity and in turn sales. And, with Retail Pro, you can collect and act on the data you need to drive more sales. The customer should be able to add to their balance at any time, making the gift card like your own private debit card system. After you have generated the sales receipt, the customer sales order, work order or layaway is marked closed.</p>
<p>A traditional retail store monitors and tracks inventory and sales as merchandise is scanned and sold at the cash register. Then this information is sent to the software in the main system, which matches information from the bar code with information in the database listing the inventory. It integrates with POS systems and streamlines taking and analyzing your beverage inventory. Essentially, though, the cost of a POS can be broken out into the expense of hardware and software, and the cost of processing payments.</p>
