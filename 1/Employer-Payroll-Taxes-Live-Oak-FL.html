<p>All retail businesses need to use cash registers but more and more high street shops and stores are now turning away from the traditional designs and are switching to POS or, to give them their full name, Point Of Sale machines. We are offering this all-in-one restaurant system which includes the pos, printer, cash drawer, pole display and also barcode scanner together with jRestaurant POS. For merchants, unattended POS systems offer an effective strategy for managing rising labor costs, as they allow one cashier to monitor customers using multiple self-serve POS kiosks instead of ringing up orders at a single station.
