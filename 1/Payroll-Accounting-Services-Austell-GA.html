<p>In running a successful business, there are few things more important than money. A point of sale system also can manage inventory levels across multiple business locations, allowing you to centralize your tracking system rather than relying on separate inventory schedules for each location. Tracking inventory accurately is a particularly tough challenge for restaurants and bars because the majority of your products aren't in simple units. The menus are outfitted with desirable features that allow guests to place orders, enter custom cooking specifications, order drinks, request table service, tender secure payment (from the table) and view detailed descriptions of menu items-inclusive of high-resolution images and wine and beer pairing options.</p>
<p>Manages the inventory- The point of sale software maintains the business' inventory. With a good (POS) point of sale system, you can keep customers loyal, and keep them spending. It is a cost-effective restaurant billing software for small business , which is also user-friendly. A POS system's inventory management module must provide complete visibility and accountability at store level at all times. For the purposes of calculating the sales total and change due this makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>The need for special tax calculations arise when you sell an item in the restaurant where the tax is added onto the sale but the same item in the bar has the tax included. With Zomato Book, you get benefits and features commonly found in the higher prices POS systems. But, taking the time to do your homework on point of sale systems can really pay off. Pre-authorization feature works great for bar tabs and lets customers hold onto their credit cards while they party.</p>

Research has shown repeatedly that errors are dozens of times more likely with manually calculated balances as opposed to those derived at automatically by software.</p>
<p>Manage the tables across your restaurant to monitor which tables are occupied, which are not and how many customers are seated at each table.
