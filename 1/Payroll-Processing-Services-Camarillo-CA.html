<p>The core of hospitality or retail business, for that matter any trade, is the cash register. After all, with customers increasingly expecting the latest and greatest tech, you don't want to be known as the bar that delivers a poor experience with dated equipment. This will include hardware components like credit card readers, touchscreen monitors, receipt printers, and barcode scanners. The key to servicing such a wide variety of retailers is our commitment to work with you directly to customize a system to meet your unique business needs.</p>
<p>Set up custom buttons to accept cash, checks, gift cards or any payment type you want. As guest management and POS system, Cake POS offers online and offline functions with an integrated hardware package. When selecting a retail POS solution, consider the type of hardware you want to use and what will be the most practical for your store. We customized the user interface to include fields for the exact data we need to sell online - things like name, subname, item, weight, dimensions, UPC, and at least three photos which we get from our wholesalers.</p>
<p>Bottom Line: Vend POS is a highly flexible and mobile point-of-sale (POS) system that, while it lacks a few advanced features and charges extra for phone support, is an excellent choice for small businesses. Regardless if you're operating a small shop or a restaurant, you would want automation to be on your side when managing sales transactions. With a good (POS) point of sale system, you'll shape inventory to meet customer needs, and find ways to improve the bottom line.</p>

Be sure to ask about customer service when considering a point of sale system for your small business.</p>

Working with leading merchant providers from around the world, Vend allows businesses to choose the best way to accept payments, including debit, credit and gift cards.</p>
