<p>Now the last thing I want is for this be a shameless promotion of the software we develop. One of the first microprocessor-controlled cash register systems was built by William Brobeck and Associates in 1974, for McDonald's Restaurants 4 It used the Intel 8008 , a very early microprocessor (and forerunner to the Intel 8088 processor used in the original IBM Personal Computer ). Each station in the restaurant had its own device which displayed the entire order for a customer — for example, 2 Vanilla Shake, 1 Large Fries, 3 BigMac — using numeric keys and a button for every menu item.</p>
<p>The hardware of a POS system consists of the physical setup like cash register connected to a PC or server, or even a portable device such as a tablet or smartphone connected to a cloud-hosted system. The TouchBistro hardware setup is simple and low cost and the licensing fees are also cheap compared to the gigantic POS systems of yore. Hardware investments are minimal, and the system is cheaper to set up than most traditional bar POS systems because it is compatible with third-party POS equipment.</p>
<p>This type of software can be easily installed on your POS terminal or tablet and has a wide range of capabilities - a notable one being the ability for you to store and view your sales data online. Remember that, like most other business solutions, a POS system should be able to reliably and efficiently address your retail business requirements. Apart from order management, restaurant table management, payment handling, inventory management, employee management, and menu management, it comes with CRM capabilities- all of which we've repeatedly tried, tested and confirmed that they indeed perform well.</p>
