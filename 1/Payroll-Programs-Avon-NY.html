<p>Choosing the right retail point of sale system and software is not a decision to take lightly. This software is popular among small retail businesses because of its clear, unlimited, and no-hidden charges plans. Lavu is a point-of-sale software solution with features such as an intelligent combination of cloud computing, wireless technologies, and a sleek touchscreen interface for restaurant. Consider how you or your staff will be taking payments from your customers. Let's take a moment to look at the different hardware and software specs as they apply to both Full Service and Quick Service Restaurants.</p>

The software itself requires hardware components like an iPad or tablet for android OS, cash drawers, card readers, bar code scanners, receipt printers, and other add-ons to offer the full point of sale experience. Hence, Inventory systems are designed so that managers can order right product at the right time, in the right quantity from the right vendor and at the right price.</p>

<p>I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc. This way, you'll have happy customers increase your restaurant's popularity. At the same time, a good POS system will allow you to accept cash, credit, and contactless payments and some will even let you accept online payments for your products and services.</p>
