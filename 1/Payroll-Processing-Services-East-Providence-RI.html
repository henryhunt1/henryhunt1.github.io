Self-service kiosks - A large self-service kiosk can help customers serve themselves, saving your staff time. An online restaurant management system is essentially a web application that is developed to automate the daily activities of a restaurant. On top of payment processing fees, many point of sale systems will charge your business for using their software. The POS serves as the central component for your business ; it's the hub where everything—like sales, inventory and customer management—merges.</p>

The TouchBistro hardware setup is simple and low cost and the licensing fees are also cheap compared to the gigantic POS systems of yore. Hardware investments are minimal, and the system is cheaper to set up than most traditional bar POS systems because it is compatible with third-party POS equipment.</p>
