<p>Now the last thing I want is for this be a shameless promotion of the software we develop. One of the first microprocessor-controlled cash register systems was built by William Brobeck and Associates in 1974, for McDonald's Restaurants 4 It used the Intel 8008 , a very early microprocessor (and forerunner to the Intel 8088 processor used in the original IBM Personal Computer ). Each station in the restaurant had its own device which displayed the entire order for a customer — for example, 2 Vanilla Shake, 1 Large Fries, 3 BigMac — using numeric keys and a button for every menu item.</p>
<p>Being a restaurateur means focusing on an efficient kitchen and providing customers with great food and drinks. The software can be integrated with card terminals from PayPal, iZettle, Square, Paymentsense, Payment Express and SumUp, and works with most POS equipment. You can see POS systems in Retail Stores, Restaurants, Hospitals and almost everywhere these days where payments are involved. You can enjoy over 300 features to help run your store- they offer everything from invoicing tools to time clocks.</p>
<p>Mentioned above is the list of some of the best restaurant management software available for purchase. All of these features help you run your business your way, the way it's meant to be run - plus it keeps your customers happy. POS systems increase security as employees are accountable for their orders, sales, and the drinks they pour. In 2015, EMV became the standard of credit card reader for its high security - making payment cards nearly impossible to copy and reduce the huge possibility of accepting counterfeit cards.</p>
