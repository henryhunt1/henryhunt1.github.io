<p>Choosing the right retail point of sale system and software is not a decision to take lightly. This software is popular among small retail businesses because of its clear, unlimited, and no-hidden charges plans. Lavu is a point-of-sale software solution with features such as an intelligent combination of cloud computing, wireless technologies, and a sleek touchscreen interface for restaurant. Consider how you or your staff will be taking payments from your customers. Let's take a moment to look at the different hardware and software specs as they apply to both Full Service and Quick Service Restaurants.</p>

Nightclub or bar POS software with preauthorization will also immediately tokenize and encrypt customer credit card information when it's swiped, so no sensitive information is stored on the device. We do custom Point of Sale software development and pin pad interfaces compatible with all third-party devices for intuitive, feature-rich payment systems and terminal appli development systems improve workflows and customer experiences with a wide selection of sought-after features, including security algorithms, customer engagement modules, and analytics engines, and much more.</p>

Typical hardware needs for POS set-ups include: credit-card swipers, computer terminals, monitors, bar-code scanners, receipt printers, touchscreens, computer peripherals such as keyboards and mice, and cash-drawers. Retain old customers, earn new ones and increase sales by offering free meals.</p>

<p>You may, for example, not need a cash drawer if the majority of sales are through card. Mobile POS systems allow employees to mingle with your customers on the store floor, deterring shoplifting. For example, you could ask customers questions such as "do you ever shop with us online?" or "would you be interested in a frequent shopper program?" Also, keep in mind that even if there are software packages designed specifically for your type of business, they may vary wildly and you still need to research the features to determine what'll work best for your business.</p>
<p>Some POS systems cater to retailers , whereas others cater to restaurants, so be sure to look for one that fits your specific needs. Accounting and payroll: Your POS system may include accounting services or integrate with third-party software like QuickBooks. Instead, let us sort through the crud and recommend the right POS systems for small businesses. So, while your sales associate is looking up stock availability from Retail Pro on an iPad or iPod Touch (or any other mobile device), they can also look up the customer's transaction history and make recommendations for cool sweaters or tees to complete their look.</p>

<p>Ordyx is a POS system for restaurants with single or multiple locations. The specialized POS design lets you keep watch and track employees, edit menus and track inventory. It used to be that smaller businesses could not easily process credit card and check payments. In addition, some states (such as California) now require some kind of customer-facing screen be available so customers can view sales information as a sale is rung up.</p>
<p>An e-commerce powerhouse, Shopify POS equips you with streamlined tools to manage your retail businesses with ease. No matter what the size of your business, keeping track of what items enter and leave you store's inventory is an important part of running an efficient business. Every store is equipped with iPads that show their company website at all times to allow for cross-selling from other stores. Operate business while on the move, take payment and monitor sales and at the same time minimize hardware set up to shorten lines with mobile inventory management in your mobile payment system.</p>
<p>Instead of using traditional punch cards, you can now track your customer loyalty incentives using the POS system. Before the POS was introduced, businesses used old-school cash tills or registers to manually process transactions. A point of sale (POS) is a place where a customer executes the payment for goods or services and where sales taxes may become payable. It is also seen as the preferred deployment method of many businesses owing to the low price tags that come with cloud-based tools And then there is the projected increase in the use of self-service kiosks, not only by restaurants but among retailers as well.</p>
