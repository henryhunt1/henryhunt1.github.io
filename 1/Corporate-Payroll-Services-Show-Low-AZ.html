<p>Point of sale systems are revolutionizing the retail and hospitality industry. Enable your retail employees with a modern web and cloud point of sale system to deliver excellent customer service everywhere in the store. Detailed sales reports can be printed by region and by store or groups of staff within stores. It's crucial for your POS system to integrate easily with inventory systems, payment processing platforms, loyalty programs, reservation systems, CRM systems, shift scheduling systems, and other such tech platforms.</p>
<p>EMV is the standard that is said to provide more security than the swipe-and-sign tech we've been using for the past decade or so. The ability to "dip" these cards means additional or new hardware for which some POS systems charge a bit extra. Affordable, easy to use, feature rich, and 100% multi-lingual restaurant point of sale and store management solution. At a time when computers were becoming commonplace, POS vendors had to adapt their software to maximise its potential.</p>
<p>Touch screen systems designed for restaurants, bars, cafes and anyplace that sales food to customers. This allows you to elevate customer service and improve turnaround time when customer orders are quickly entered front of house and immediately available to back of house for processing. Meanwhile, the Smart Table Management gives you the real-time status of your tables so that you can keep a close tab on orders and payments.</p>

And speaking of which, it turns that the Lightspeed Restaurant POS system has a pretty flexible payment framework. The tipping function ensures accurate earnings calculations and easy tip splits at business close time.</p>
<p>That feature is a key for busy restaurants: Toast Go also means servers can run customer credit cards right at the table and have the receipt emailed to them. If all you need is to have a total amount of cash in the drawer that sometimes matches to the amount of sales shown you probably don't need a point of sale system.

In order to take payment from cards with a chip, your credit card reader will need to accept what is known as EMV payment —a global standard for chip-based debit and credit card transactions. Most restaurants that have iPad self-order menus include photos of the dishes so guests can easily choose what they want to order.</p>

These provide retailers with tools ranging from order management and inventory tracking to customer management and payment processing for more seamless transactions.</p>
