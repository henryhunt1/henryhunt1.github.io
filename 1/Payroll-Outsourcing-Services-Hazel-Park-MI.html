This software is popular among small retail businesses because of its clear, unlimited, and no-hidden charges plans. Lavu is a point-of-sale software solution with features such as an intelligent combination of cloud computing, wireless technologies, and a sleek touchscreen interface for restaurant. Consider how you or your staff will be taking payments from your customers. Let's take a moment to look at the different hardware and software specs as they apply to both Full Service and Quick Service Restaurants.</p>
<p>Motivate customers to visit your bar again by rewarding them with bonus points using the loyalty program. Don't miss this opportunity to reach out to your customers with a timely delivery to build brand loyalty among your customers.

It suits inventory-based retailers, customizing the way they conduct ecommerce.</p>

Safe, secure and fast payments: EPOS systems often come equipped with card machines, meaning payments are safe and secure.

<p>It reviews the 7 top restaurant point of sale applications to help you get a clear picture of the type of software and features you should expect, the accompanying pricing, plus possible weaknesses. Plus through out the day it will adjust the inventory that the store holds and take away the amount every time a particular item is sold. Square for Retail narrows the product's scope a bit, simplifying some aspects of the POS software while beefing up its inventory.</p>
<p>Amazon's concept convenience store, Amazon Go, which deploys technologies that let shoppers come in, grab items, and walk out without going through a register, could revolutionize POS systems. Your bar customer is paying the same amount as a customer in the restaurant.
