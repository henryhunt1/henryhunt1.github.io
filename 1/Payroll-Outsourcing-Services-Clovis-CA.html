<p>For any restaurant, point of sale technology is important. Retailers can reasonably expect to acquire such systems (including hardware) for about $4000 US (as of 2009) per checkout lane. Sometimes, even after spending a lot of valuable time searching for the best possible system, restaurant owners end up making a mistake by basing their final decision on cost alone. Stock Visibility — keeping track of product movement can help retailers avoid stock-outs or dead stocks and thus improve customer relationships.</p>

Other Square features allow restaurants to send invoices, manage payroll and integrate with third-party applications such as QuickBooks, Xero and TaxJar.</p>
