<p>As the world is becoming cashless, more and more business are adopting cashless payment solutions, one of which is automatic payroll deduction. NCR Silver uses the normal POS tablet layout with user buttons on the right and open sales on the left. Thrive POS provides a comprehensive suite of restaurant business solutions designed to increase top-line sales and decrease costs. In a restaurant, it's necessary to have reliable, durable POS hardware. They offer a multi-tier loyalty feature which permits business owners to track how much their customers spend, and offer rewards as they seem fit.</p>
<p>This user-friendly tool is free and enables businesses to accept and process payments both in-store and even on-the-go, for both iOS or Android gadgets. Generally, if your business has annual sales of $500k or more, you can achieve considerable savings and benefits from a POS system. Depending on the POS vendor and the terms of contract, compared to traditional on-premises POS installation, the software is more likely to be continually updated by the developer with more useful features and better performance in terms of computer resources at the remote server and in terms of lesser bugs and errors.</p>
<p>While some retailers still use systems as described above, many are moving on to advanced cloud-based POS systems where data is stored online. Typical hardware needs for POS set-ups include: credit-card swipers, computer terminals, monitors, bar-code scanners, receipt printers, touchscreens, computer peripherals such as keyboards and mice, and cash-drawers. Retain old customers, earn new ones and increase sales by offering free meals.</p>

Special order templates, predefined or packages on-the-fly and a guided sales processes improve customer satisfaction with quick and accurate data entry. A specialized system with bar-specific features will do so much more for your business than a general POS. These stand-alone systems will store all necessary information for the purpose of delivering or transmitting the information to the central computer at a later time for processing.</p>

For retail stores, winning shoppers' loyalty is accomplished when their needs are met and their shopping experience leaves them satisfied that they received quality products at competitive prices and great customer service.</p>
<p>I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc. This way, you'll have happy customers increase your restaurant's popularity. At the same time, a good POS system will allow you to accept cash, credit, and contactless payments and some will even let you accept online payments for your products and services.</p>
