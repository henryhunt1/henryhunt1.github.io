<p>Choosing a Point of Sale System is not a simple task. Although improving the ergonomics is possible, a clean, fast-paced look may come at the expense of sacrificing functions that are often wanted by end-users such as discounts, access to commission earned screens, membership and loyalty schemes can involve looking at a different function of the POS to ensure the point of sale screen contains only what a cashier needs at their disposal to serve customers.</p>

Your Striven POS solution is a power feature rich platform, offering hardware retailers with one or 100 stores the most power industry designed solution on the market today. A supermarket with high traffic cannot afford a systemic failure, hence each point of sale station should not only be very robust both in terms of software, database and hardware specifications but also designed in such a way as to prevent causing a systemic failure - such as may happen through the use of a single central database for operations.</p>

<p>That is because these other business types will especially require an appointment calendar and may need retail functionality with inventory control, and not every software program has those features. Analyzing transaction data as a whole, like what customers purchase from you, when and how often, can be more useful for your longer-term marketing efforts, to better segment your shoppers and create personalized email offers based on their purchase history.</p>
<p>Choosing retail POS software that is cloud-based, as opposed to a local server-based, can save you money too. A cookie is a small piece of data that a website stores on the visitor's computer or mobile device. Retail stores require different types of POS equipment.
