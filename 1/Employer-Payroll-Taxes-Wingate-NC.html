<p>POS stands for "point of sale" and it is generally used to describe the computer used to check out customers. 4. POS Software - Again this would seem obvious, but many all-in-one POS systems simply consist of an empty hardware shell with nothing running on it. Likewise, an all-in-one printer would not scan, fax, or print without software driving features. Some systems offer both inventory control and accounting modules but most successful retailers use completely different systems for each one. Sales Reporting: On the surface, most POS systems enable you to look at your sales.</p>
<p>Analyse and View the sales report of each restaurant in case of multiple outlets in detail.Compare and analyze the weekly and monthly sales of each outlet through simple graphical reports. 6. POS retail software makes it easier to keep track of customer personal information, staff payroll, customer billing and shipping, vendor listings, and inventory management. Restaurants can process payments through Upserve at a flat rate per transaction or integrate with third-party processors Heartland Payments, Chase Paymentech, First Data, TSYS or Global Payment.</p>
<p>The reporting functionality allows managers to see their sales broken down by item sales, discounts and comps, refunds, net sales, and taxes in a searchable interface that can display revenue from the past week, past 30 days, or other set timeframe. A point of sale (POS) system is where customers make a payment for goods or services at your store. It's all about customer retention, which is up to five times less expensive than attracting new customers.</p>

Accounting and payroll: Your POS system may include accounting services or integrate with third-party software like QuickBooks. Instead, let us sort through the crud and recommend the right POS systems for small businesses.

<p>Obviously, you need to consider the cost of the POS system (including the hardware and software). Utilizing features like inventory management will help you find where to cut food costs and to boost profit margins by using recipe costing. But, using a POS that is tailored to retail isn't wise because a restaurant is a completely different business with different needs. Manage multiple locations and sales channels in real time, from any compatible device, including products, customers, and staff.</p>
<p>It is a must in retail stores earning revenue above $7, 00,000. If you are using a tablet-based POS system, there is one more thing that you can do to increase your customers' satisfaction.
