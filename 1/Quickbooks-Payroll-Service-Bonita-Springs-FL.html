<p>If you are planning on starting a new retail business, or run a retail business and wish to streamline your operation, a crucial component that should be factored into your business plans is a modern day point of sale system and more precisely the benefits a good POS system can offer to the running of your business. A right POS should also keep track of inventory at other branches and provide continuous insights on product sales. As point of sale systems evolved, they became more computerised, storing a product database on a computer server. In addition, you can use them with back-end accounting systems and credit card payment processors Many small to midsize businesses (SMBs) are using these types of cloud-enabled POS services without the need to keep a physical back-end server in multiple locations.</p>
<p>Set up custom buttons to accept cash, checks, gift cards or any payment type you want. As guest management and POS system, Cake POS offers online and offline functions with an integrated hardware package. When selecting a retail POS solution, consider the type of hardware you want to use and what will be the most practical for your store. We customized the user interface to include fields for the exact data we need to sell online - things like name, subname, item, weight, dimensions, UPC, and at least three photos which we get from our wholesalers.</p>
<p>While some retailers still use systems as described above, many are moving on to advanced cloud-based POS systems where data is stored online. Typical hardware needs for POS set-ups include: credit-card swipers, computer terminals, monitors, bar-code scanners, receipt printers, touchscreens, computer peripherals such as keyboards and mice, and cash-drawers. Retain old customers, earn new ones and increase sales by offering free meals.</p>

<p>I've used livepos since I opened my store in 2014 and it never disappoints me.

Simplify your accounting process, build demand conscious rosters, generate online orders, and drive sales through loyalty programs with hospitality's most integrated point of sale. The point of sales software is defined by its collection centre which needs to be efficient while collecting tender information, redeeming loyalty points, gift vouchers or coupon codes or applying any bill discounts or promotions.</p>
<p>Manage the tables across your restaurant to monitor which tables are occupied, which are not and how many customers are seated at each table. If you are planning a very small operation, such as bagel or sandwich shop, you may not need a POS system at the opening time, especially if you aren't going to take credit cards (and there are plenty of places that still don't accept plastic). With this feature, if your business receives a reminder to refill a stock of inventory, you'll simply have to press a few buttons within your POS to do so. Keep in mind that first you'll have to onboard your vendors into your POS system.</p>
