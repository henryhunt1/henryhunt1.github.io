<p>Retailers need to consider the negative consequences of failing to have a POS in place. According to the State of Small Business report, an incredible 46% of small businesses don't track their inventory or use a manual process to do so. A Point Of Sale (POS) System is the combination of hardware and software that is used to sell stuff to customers, and organise the processes related to sales. The point of sale system is designed for delivery, carry-out or dine-in type restaurant businesses.</p>
<p>For example, many retailers use POS systems to manage membership programs that award points to frequent buyers and issue discounts on future purchases. POS systems record each time you check out a customer and automatically deduct the purchased item from your inventory list, which is maintained on the systems' hard drive. With the POS software, you don't need terminals, cash registers, barcode scanners, or receipt and label printers.</p>
<p>Thus should the remote server fail, the cashier can switch over to the local sale window without disrupting sales. Using handheld POS systems, employees can quickly and effortlessly accept orders, process payments, and complete transactions all while interacting with their guests. Setting up Cybersys POS is a straightforward process, with your list of customers, suppliers, or gift cards easily transferred from one store to the next.</p>
