<p>All retail businesses need to use cash registers but more and more high street shops and stores are now turning away from the traditional designs and are switching to POS or, to give them their full name, Point Of Sale machines. We are offering this all-in-one restaurant system which includes the pos, printer, cash drawer, pole display and also barcode scanner together with jRestaurant POS. For merchants, unattended POS systems offer an effective strategy for managing rising labor costs, as they allow one cashier to monitor customers using multiple self-serve POS kiosks instead of ringing up orders at a single station. These systems are best suited for small businesses and entrepreneurs, small retail stores, pop-up shops, and quick-serve establishments.</p>
<p>This user-friendly tool is free and enables businesses to accept and process payments both in-store and even on-the-go, for both iOS or Android gadgets. Generally, if your business has annual sales of $500k or more, you can achieve considerable savings and benefits from a POS system. Depending on the POS vendor and the terms of contract, compared to traditional on-premises POS installation, the software is more likely to be continually updated by the developer with more useful features and better performance in terms of computer resources at the remote server and in terms of lesser bugs and errors.</p>
<p>But if you're specifically opening a pizza shop, for example, there are POS systems built just for that with integrations that allow online ordering and delivery tracking. Another feature-rich free POS software is Linga , which is designed specifically for food service businesses. This way, you're saving customers from disappointment and you're saving sales. In addition to a full setup with an iPad stand, receipt printer and cash drawer, it offers a mobile POS option for accepting payments at the table.</p>

<p>The LS One retail POS system is fully platform-independent and can support any number of POS devices, whether stationary or mobile, to connect at the same time. The FoodEngine POS which has promised results for many restaurants comes in two licenses â€” Perpetual (both Annual and Monthly premiums) and SaaS (only Monthly Premium). You can process payments on your store's floor (especially useful for cutting down lines at the register during busy seasons), at an expo, or at an outdoor pop-up shop.</p>
<p>Credit and debit card preauthorization (or "preauth") allows bartenders to swipe a customer's credit card, securely save that information as their bar tab, and verify that the card is real and has a preconfigured amount of funds on it. Therefore, buying the POS hardware is the right decision, even if you comprise a few features to cut down the initial cost. The ShopKeep Restaurant POS system generates solid insights, which come handy when you're making critical business decisions.</p>
<p>It's imperative to choose the restaurant management software that best suits your business requirements. Get an excellent solution for your business with Point of Sale Software.

<p>Avoid losing sales and increase customer satisfaction with a faster and more convenient checkout experience. Most popular restaurant POS systems offer a free trial or demo of their product. There are multiple factors in achieving PCI compliance, including the POS system and credit card processing service you use, whether your business stores cardholder data, and whether your network and internet connection are secure.</p>
