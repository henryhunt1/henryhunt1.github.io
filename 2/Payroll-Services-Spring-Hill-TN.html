The POS systems control various activities in the restaurant. By combining the data from your POS and payment processing systems, you gain insights into your best-selling products and which items to push back. While there are several kinds of payment processing solutions available, including credit card readers and various new mobile payment methods, the POS systems we reviewed are full-on cash registers. Reliable bar software should also offer beverage service-specific features, such as being able to transfer tabs and split checks and run customer tabs.</p>
<p>Our Restaurant Software are distributed on Cloud so data retrieval is real time. As the next-generation point-of-sale system, with cloud-based service, SaaS architecture, and bid data analysis, we help customers to achieve marketing, operations, management and all-round development of smart restaurants.

<p>It can be all too easy to lose track of someone's drink order or miss a customer waiting to place a drink order at the bar. This not only means that you'll be able to serve a greater number of guests in a shorter amount of time, but also that your staff members can spend more time interacting with your guests and VIPs instead of maneuvering back and forth through the crowd to access a central payment terminal.</p>
<p>In both cases, the POS system will allow your business to accept card payments and handle a variety of back-office functions. The POSsible POS software is simple and efficient for our business.

<p>As well as actually allowing the customer to purchase goods, POS systems allow the business operator to do nearly everything from ordering and purchasing stock to generating reports on sales. 22 The report goes on to say that "the number of franchise restaurants impacted by these cyber security attacks is now expected to be considerably higher than the 300 restaurants already implicated" and that the "hackers made hundreds of thousands of fraudulent purchases on credit and debit cards issued by various financial institutions after breaching Wendy's computer systems late last year".</p>
