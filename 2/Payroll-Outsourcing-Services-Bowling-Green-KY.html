<p>Retailers need to consider the negative consequences of failing to have a POS in place. According to the State of Small Business report, an incredible 46% of small businesses don't track their inventory or use a manual process to do so. A Point Of Sale (POS) System is the combination of hardware and software that is used to sell stuff to customers, and organise the processes related to sales. The point of sale system is designed for delivery, carry-out or dine-in type restaurant businesses.</p>
<p>For example, many retailers use POS systems to manage membership programs that award points to frequent buyers and issue discounts on future purchases. POS systems record each time you check out a customer and automatically deduct the purchased item from your inventory list, which is maintained on the systems' hard drive. With the POS software, you don't need terminals, cash registers, barcode scanners, or receipt and label printers.</p>
<p>This POS system has SMS messaging, inventory management, and loyalty programs, compatible with PC, Mac, iPhone, and Windows Mobile. With the POS technology, the system's software uses the barcode on the label of the item you bought (or the key code for the particular entrÃ©e or drink, in the case of a restaurant) as an inventory regulation system as well as an efficient way to control the transaction. A lot of big box stores have wildly expensive POS solutions, some of which were custom built for their needs.</p>
