<p>In running a successful business, there are few things more important than money. A point of sale system also can manage inventory levels across multiple business locations, allowing you to centralize your tracking system rather than relying on separate inventory schedules for each location. Tracking inventory accurately is a particularly tough challenge for restaurants and bars because the majority of your products aren't in simple units. The menus are outfitted with desirable features that allow guests to place orders, enter custom cooking specifications, order drinks, request table service, tender secure payment (from the table) and view detailed descriptions of menu items-inclusive of high-resolution images and wine and beer pairing options.</p>
<p>The order management system features an activity dashboard that provides weekly or monthly sales reports for stock managers. In fact, research shows that more than half (52 percent) of retailers are arming store associates with mobile technology—and another 26 percent plan to do the same. Tillpoint is the multi-award-winning POS & Restaurant Management System. Mobile POS is now available that keeps POS users from being tied down to a specific location in a store.</p>
<p>POS software is installed at the very place the main transaction occurs at a retail store. Talech has a large how-to library and experienced customer support to help most restaurants quickly get the essentials operational. Accept all major cards, contactless and mobile payments - including Samsung, Google and Apple Pay - in seconds. The software caters to quick-service and full-service establishments, with a configurable toolset for nightclubs, pizzerias, bars, and chains in the US.

POS hardware can be a stationary terminal or a mobile device, such as a tablet or iPad.
