<p>I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc. This way, you'll have happy customers increase your restaurant's popularity.

<p>In the hospitality industry a POS system is much better because of the different needs, requests, and reservations of customers. WillPower Pos systems were developed to suit a wide variety of businesses from Retail to Hospitality and specialized shops.
