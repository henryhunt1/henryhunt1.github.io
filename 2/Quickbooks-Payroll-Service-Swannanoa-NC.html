<p>It's hard to envision a retail or point of sale (POS) environment that doesn't make use of touch technology. Manhattan Point of Sale is the next generation POS system for retail, helping retailers sell, fulfill, and engage anywhere. Bar menus change all the time, and your point of sale system should adapt to it. Whether you offer happy hour specials or a new food item on your menu, you want a system that can sync all the information. It is used to store Money, credit card receipts and other paperwork. The primary differences between Quick Service and Full Service POS systems can be found in the software and hardware specifications.</p>
<p>Features include inventory management, sales analytics, digital receipts and loyalty programs. Add to that robust multi-location management tools and an amazing array of ready integrations, and you tailor Lightspeed to fit your exact bar service needs. Offer customers the option of leaving a security deposit or partial payment towards items instead of paying all at once. From the console, retailers can create products, check stock, change prices, run sales reports, and more.</p>

<p>Perhaps a retail store uses touch technology when they check out a customer at the department store. The business owners only have to download an app and create an account for a mobile POS system.
