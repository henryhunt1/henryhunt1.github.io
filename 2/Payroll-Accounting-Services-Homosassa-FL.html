<p>RETAILvantage POS Retail systems will keep your customers satisfied and provide you with powerful analysis of what is truly selling. Once you have it installed it can take a little bit of time getting your items, customers, and employees into the system. Any business records sales, but a restaurant must also be able to accept reservations and know which orders were placed from which table. Our POS software help you to keep a track on your sales with ease and aplomb. Since the system works through handheld devices connected to a main POS server, potential errors and omissions in the manual order taking process of the traditional point of sale restaurant are eliminated.</p>

Tableside service helps restaurants reduce or fully eliminate the constant travel by servers between tables and a terminal. Apart from inventory management, you should be able to coordinate customer orders, process payments, track all the restaurant elements, as well as manage your staff right from the point of sale system.</p>
<p>FusionRestro includes accounting, billing, staff and payroll functions, inventory management, and customer information management.

<p>This online restaurant management system is all in one package for your business. For example, ShopKeep and TouchBistro build their systems around food and beverage businesses like quick-service restaurants, bars, and coffee shops.

<p>Perhaps the most valuable way POS systems help you gain better control of your business is through their reporting features. One capability they'll look for is a unified commerce platform that allows them to offer customers a seamless shopping experience that spans in-person, online and mobile channels. Most POS systems allow you to set reminders when certain inventory stocks are running low. We provide with various types of POS application development including restaurants, bar, cafes, retail business and much more.</p>

Modern restaurant POS systems provide a platform that sits at the heart of any food and beverage operation, large or small, helping to enhance the customer experience and streamline business operations.
