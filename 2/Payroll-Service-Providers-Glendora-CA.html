<p>Point of sale or POS systems are a necessary and invaluable part of most businesses. Restaurants need the ability to securely sell, track and redeem gift card transactions without transaction fees. For example, some restaurants require that items selected by the customers be attended to and can only be placed by the waiter who has the password required to do so. This prevents fake orders - such as may be entered by playful kids - and subsequent dispute on the items ordered. Collecting information even before your guests walk in your restaurant will keep you better prepared for your staff pre-service.</p>
<p>Talk to your Retail Systems Inc sales agent to learn more about mobile apps. Enlite POS from Dark POS is designed for dry cleaning businesses with one or multiple locations. Increase your sales and profitability by expanding your bar and alcohol business. Its interface provides options for mobile devices and traditional brick and mortar stores where everything is easily accessible from the welcome screen. For example, if you're opening up a salon, you may want to look for a POS system that can handle complex scheduling and one that can manage payments and tipping to multiple individual employees.</p>
<p>Free up valuable counter space with this compact and affordable system, which provides retailers of all sizes with reliability and connectivity features that help maximize operating cost efficiency. On the back end, it also features several functions such as managing inventory, purchase orders, and managing staff. BNG Point-of-Sale works with your business to find the best POS solution for you, but it doesn't end there.</p>

<p>A point-of-sale system gives you the ability to accept whatever form of payment your customers prefer. Scanning the bar code at the Point of Sale rather than typing an SKU virtually eliminates errors in pricing and inventory. Global inventory, cross-channel orders and customer profiles are completely visible in real-time so associates are equipped to deliver thoughtful, knowledge-based interactions with a personal touch.</p>
<p>Since this is a cloud-based Point of Sales system, you can always check your inventory level and order new goods whether you are in the office, at home or on the go.

There is also the possibility for order kiosks, allowing customers to place their own orders directly into the POS system and bypassing servers entirely.</p>
<p>The sole purpose of any Point of Sale System setup by any store is to improve sales and profits by keeping track of all the products being sold or purchased at the retail store.

You need to make sure that the POS hardware - the scanners, computers, and printers - is compatible with the software you have chosen. POS hardware can be a stationary terminal or a mobile device, such as a tablet or iPad. For the cash register, the POS terminal is a computerized replacement that helps in processing credit and debit cards.</p>
