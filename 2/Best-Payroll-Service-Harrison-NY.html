ShopKeep's simple, powerful retail POS solution has allowed thousands of business owners to thrive while doing what they adore. Not one interface for all : A custom-made POS system interface calls for the incorporation of the unique in-house features that has taken the bar to its present height. Founded in 2005 with headquarters in Canada, Lightspeed is a cloud-based point of sale system for restaurants and bars of all sizes.</p>
<p>This method of inventory management is more effective than the limited system, and when combined with strong loss-prevention procedures can result in large cost reductions per month. Host Jon Taffer recently endorsed many of our award winning point of sale systems to help struggling bars and nightclubs improve their efficiency and profitability. After testing dozens of POS systems, we found TouchBistro to be a top-of-the-line EMV-compliant system that also integrates an end-to-end restaurant management system.</p>
