IVend Retail presents a series of seven tightly integrated software modules that bridge your eCommerce and bricks-and-mortar presence to help you exceed your customer's great omnichannel expectations.

<p>The Offline Mode will not let you process integrated payments, edit & remove current customer profiles, or to discard and park sales. Nightclub or bar POS software with preauthorization will also immediately tokenize and encrypt customer credit card information when it's swiped, so no sensitive information is stored on the device.

<p>Point of Sale Security : Using restaurant POS software, all employees are accountable for any sales rung up on their personal ID. Servers can not alter checks without a password, putting a stop to unapproved discounts for friends and family members, and eliminating the opportunity for theft.

<p>A point of sale system, or POS, is the place where your customer makes a payment for products or services at your store. There is also a table management module, a sales reports module, and other features like top-tracking. Imagine restaurant POS systems that can tell which customers are in which seat at which table, and charge them for their food individually and automatically without a single credit card passing hands.</p>
