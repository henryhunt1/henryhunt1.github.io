<p>Point of sale or POS systems are a necessary and invaluable part of most businesses. Restaurants need the ability to securely sell, track and redeem gift card transactions without transaction fees. For example, some restaurants require that items selected by the customers be attended to and can only be placed by the waiter who has the password required to do so. This prevents fake orders - such as may be entered by playful kids - and subsequent dispute on the items ordered. Collecting information even before your guests walk in your restaurant will keep you better prepared for your staff pre-service.</p>
<p>GiftLogic is Windows-based POS software for retailers. The sales module lets you tag your popular selling items for building a business. An often-overlooked capability of point of sale software is the ability of intelligent software to assist in promoting increased sales volumes. The availability of local processing power, local data storage, networking, and graphical user interface made it possible to develop flexible and highly functional POS systems.</p>
<p>Its solutions include POS software, traditional POS hardware systems with touchscreen monitors, and mobile POS systems that use tablets. You have secure access to your data anywhere across multiple stores, and new features are always a free update away. And to top it off, Square for Restaurant comes with all the fundamental features you'd want from a restaurant POS system. With this plan you will receive inventory management for up to 1,000 products, sales analytics, the ability to send digital receipts, employee and customer management features, plus mobile connectivity and the ability to sell offline.</p>

POS systems also affect the kitchen, as many POS systems either include, or interface with, a ticketing system to help keep orders organized and service moving smoothly.

Clover is capable of processing both debit and credit card payments and those made through Apple Pay.
