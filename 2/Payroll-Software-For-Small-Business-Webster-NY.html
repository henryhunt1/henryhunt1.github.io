<p>Easy Retail for You (er4u) Small Business POS Software can be used on a number of devices or hardwares. The QuickBooks POS is essentially a separate business software that can be used in support of the overall QuickBooks Enterprise Solutions package. Whether it's something as small as a smartphone plugin, or something as large as an entire countertop register, the hardware for your point of sale system will likely cost your business a one-off lump sum. Adapt to your customers' needs with convertible point of sale systems.</p>
<p>Bartenders should know how to make any drink order a customer can throw at them, even if it's not on the menu. Choosing a system that uses unlocked POS hardware can save you money because, if you decide to switch systems, you may be able to continue using the unlocked equipment. ShopKeep also offers a countertop POS hardware for the register, card reader and receipt printer. It also has a built-in timeclock and sales reports that show your most popular items, busiest hours, and top employees.</p>
