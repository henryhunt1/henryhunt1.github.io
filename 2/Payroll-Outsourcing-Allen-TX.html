<p>POS or Point of Sale refers to the system that records financial transactions in stores and restaurants. Comprehensive inventory management. Easily run promos by putting some items on sale and labeling them with messages like Buy One Take One” or Get 50% Off on Selected Items.” These promos can help you boost sales and improve your inventory by letting go of some of your stocks. You need a POS system that secures every retail transaction, maintaining a record of your customer's contact details, dynamic evaluation of employee performance, and generate sales reports anytime.</p>

<p>Reporting is also a paramount consideration, so when it comes to selecting a retail management software, you'll want customized reporting with detailed customer reporting, sales reports, vendor reporting, and inventory stock levels. POS systems let retailers track their inventory across multiple stores in different locations. The company should have references, provide after-hours technical support, provide warranty protection, assist with incorporating the system in the business, and are up-to-date on software and new features.</p>

Also, you'll want to train your staff on important features like upselling, inventory management, and end of day reports, all from the POS itself.

<p>I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc. This way, you'll have happy customers increase your restaurant's popularity.
