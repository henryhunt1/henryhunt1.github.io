<p>All retail businesses need to use cash registers but more and more high street shops and stores are now turning away from the traditional designs and are switching to POS or, to give them their full name, Point Of Sale machines. We are offering this all-in-one restaurant system which includes the pos, printer, cash drawer, pole display and also barcode scanner together with jRestaurant POS. For merchants, unattended POS systems offer an effective strategy for managing rising labor costs, as they allow one cashier to monitor customers using multiple self-serve POS kiosks instead of ringing up orders at a single station. These systems are best suited for small businesses and entrepreneurs, small retail stores, pop-up shops, and quick-serve establishments.</p>
<p>Key features include table management, coursing, menu management and sales reporting. The point of sale system can be integrated with your other systems and software such as eCommerce platforms, accounting apps, ERP and warehouse systems. With traditional licensed based POS system, the only knowledge possible to obtain prior to purchase comes from words from your sales rep or doing as much research as possible to find reviews online.</p>
<p>A traditional retail store monitors and tracks inventory and sales as merchandise is scanned and sold at the cash register. Then this information is sent to the software in the main system, which matches information from the bar code with information in the database listing the inventory. It integrates with POS systems and streamlines taking and analyzing your beverage inventory. Essentially, though, the cost of a POS can be broken out into the expense of hardware and software, and the cost of processing payments.</p>
