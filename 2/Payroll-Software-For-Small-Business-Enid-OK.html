<p>Smartphone app ShopKeep Pocket,‚Äù available in the App Store and Google Play, lets you see daily reports and check in on your bar's sales in real-time using your smartphone.

Features include order management, inventory tracking, a timeclock and sales analytics.</p>
<p>Basic point of sale systems currently in use include standalone electronic cash registers, also known as ECRs; ECR-based network systems; and controller-based systems. Cloud-based POS systems are different from traditional POS largely because user data, including sales and inventory, are not stored locally, but in a remote server. The software features advanced caller ID integration to easily manage incoming calls.</p>
<p>On-Premise - There are broad ranges of features in on-premise modules, and it is difficult and time-consuming to add new functionalities in this POS solution.
