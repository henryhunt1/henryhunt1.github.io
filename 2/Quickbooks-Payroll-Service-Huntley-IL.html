<p>Point of sale or POS systems are a necessary and invaluable part of most businesses. Restaurants need the ability to securely sell, track and redeem gift card transactions without transaction fees. For example, some restaurants require that items selected by the customers be attended to and can only be placed by the waiter who has the password required to do so. This prevents fake orders - such as may be entered by playful kids - and subsequent dispute on the items ordered. Collecting information even before your guests walk in your restaurant will keep you better prepared for your staff pre-service.</p>
<p>The problem with this is that it's often more expensive and the hardware is probably going to be unusable if you switch POS software. If you plan to stick with the payment-processing service you are currently using, you should look at POS systems that will work with that system (known as integrated processing‚Äù because the outside company's payments are incorporated into a POS). With a flat and predictable monthly service fee, it's beneficial for merchants who want the lowest TCO (total cost of ownership) of any other full-featured touchscreen point-of-sale systems in the hospitality industry.</p>
<p>The POS system is widely deployed by ecommerce stores and many brick-and-mortar stores. Everything is customized to your business based on the features, add-ons, and hardware that you need. Erply is cloud-hybrid POS software for retailers; it suits independent stores as well as large chains. It is easy for software sales people to confuse you along the way. After all, most of us don't think of food as being "inventory," and therefore don't see a logical connection between a UPC bar code number and a yogurt parfait.</p>

Having staff carrying around iPads can make your business look more professional and save time with customer queries but there is, obviously, a cost premium per device.</p>
<p>However, we believe this provider has the best restaurant point of sale software. Restaurants can process payments through Moneris, Cayan, Premier and Mercury, SmoothPay and PayPal. Besides increasing convenience, this could enable POSs, loyalty, and payments to be rolled into a single customer-centric experience. Hardware such as computers, monitors, and printers is often included in the purchase price of restaurant POS systems.</p>
<p>If your business is lean and mean, or if you're episodically using the POS, you'll only pay the processing fee of 2.75% per charge for credit cards (the fee is slightly higher for cash payments). In short, therefore, you can think of the whole thing as a centralized restaurant management system. Vape Shops: Although casual consumers tend to classify vape stores with tobacco shops, these two business types typically use different point of sale features.</p>
