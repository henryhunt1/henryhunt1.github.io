<p>Why should you worry about the Point of Sale system you use in your business? Web-based solution that provides restaurant POS through credit card integration, automation, call center and more. You manage your inventory and order at two places and you have to keep an eye on your stock every time a sale is made. You'll also have access to the ShopKeep mobile app, where you can view real-time sales information, inventory, and data from anywhere on the go. This makes it easy for you to keep an eye on your business even when you're not physically present on location.</p>
<p>We culled seven of the best POS systems depending on a restaurant's particular needs. Our POS software enables restaurateurs to improve the profitability of their business through faster and more accurate order processing, multiple integrated modules like customer interface, employee interface, and access to 100+ reports. Another benefit of cash: there are no associated credit card fees. As per the business requirement, the mPOS can be connected to external hardware like card reader, cash drawer, printer, and barcode scanner.</p>
<p>First Data and ICICI Merchant Services combines a payment gateway and point-of-sale software and hardware solutions with features such as card & check acceptance, and merchant mobile commerce solutions, and ecommerce gateway. Another helpful option is setting up a few kiosks in your large retail store for your customers to look up pricing and product availability. POS systems now integrate more seamlessly with other back-end applications such as customer relationship management (CRM) and inventory management.</p>

The best POS software for small business is Toast POS, which carries numerous features designed to handle US-based restaurants' booking, online ordering, and stocks management.

<p>The LS One retail POS system is fully platform-independent and can support any number of POS devices, whether stationary or mobile, to connect at the same time. The FoodEngine POS which has promised results for many restaurants comes in two licenses — Perpetual (both Annual and Monthly premiums) and SaaS (only Monthly Premium).

<p>You want to be sure that your POS system can handle all of these latest emerging systems, but you also need to know if that implementation will hinder or help your Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (aka PCI DSS)-compliance efforts or whether it will please or annoy your customers. While each of those establishments are classified as restaurants, they all have very different demands when it comes to choosing the right POS system for their specific needs.</p>
<p>It is hard to find a mechanical cash register today; the majority of POS systems are electronic, meaning they use an electronic cash register or computer system. When customers call a restaurant to order take-out or delivery, they want the experience to be as quick and painless as possible — from phone call to receipt of their order. All reports about the bills, orders, sales, customers, etc. Increase sales and profit, by serving your customers faster and avoid common mistakes that happen in the point of sale checkout lane.</p>
<p>For old-school, on-premise systems, the cash register was the POS terminal. IPad devices provide a solution that helps eliminate order confusion, lagging service, and incomplete sales data. A dishonest cashier at a retail outlet can collude with a friend who pretends to be just another customer. Or log in to your mobile app and view or print sales receipt easily. Personalized engagement: Seamless customer engagement - including clienteling and case management - is at the core of our POS, providing the tools associates need to personalize interactions to drive sales and deliver exceptional in-store service.</p>
