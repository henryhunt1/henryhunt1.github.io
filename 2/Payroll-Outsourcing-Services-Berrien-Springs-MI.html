<p>Choosing a POS, or point of sale, system seems as though it would be quite easy. For instance, while a restaurant is typically concerned about how the sale window functions, whether it has functionality such as for creating item buttons, for various discounts, for adding a service charge, for holding of receipts, for queuing, for table service as well as for takeaways, merging and splitting of a receipt, these capabilities may yet be insufficient for a spa or slimming center which would require in addition a scheduling window with historical records of customers' attendance and their special requirements.</p>
<p>Intuitive inventory management and ordering tools save time and money, while dynamic scheduling tools help you ensure you have the right amount of staff in-house at all times. One cool benefit of POS software is that it can build individual profiles of all your customers and track their purchase history and shopping habits. They go above and beyond payment processing by automating all the critical management tasks, hence streamlining business operations as well as communication.</p>
<p>In addition to the standard restaurant-centric features, it offers many useful features specific to bars. Refunds and store credit can be offered and Shopify allows for pretty much any payment option you can think of.
