<p>Onetap is hospitality point of sale, stock control, customer loyalty, reporting and integrated software using smart technology for restaurants, cafes, bars and more. The POS systems control various activities in the restaurant. By combining the data from your POS and payment processing systems, you gain insights into your best-selling products and which items to push back. While there are several kinds of payment processing solutions available, including credit card readers and various new mobile payment methods, the POS systems we reviewed are full-on cash registers. Reliable bar software should also offer beverage service-specific features, such as being able to transfer tabs and split checks and run customer tabs.</p>
<p>The problem with this is that it's often more expensive and the hardware is probably going to be unusable if you switch POS software. If you plan to stick with the payment-processing service you are currently using, you should look at POS systems that will work with that system (known as integrated processing” because the outside company's payments are incorporated into a POS). With a flat and predictable monthly service fee, it's beneficial for merchants who want the lowest TCO (total cost of ownership) of any other full-featured touchscreen point-of-sale systems in the hospitality industry.</p>
<p>If your vision calls for an integrated retail management solution that delivers an exceptional user and customer experience, you've come to the right place. It helps you manage database easily and save time to enter again the number of products being purchased in a day. For example, Square offers a customer loyalty program where customers earn redeemable points on sales. With the proliferation of low-priced touchscreen tablet computers, more and more restaurants have implemented self-ordering through tablet POS placed permanently on every table.</p>

With this feature, if your business receives a reminder to refill a stock of inventory, you'll simply have to press a few buttons within your POS to do so. Keep in mind that first you'll have to onboard your vendors into your POS system.</p>

<p>Sometimes the term POS may be used interchangeably with the term point of service, as customers may use the same technology to make returns.
