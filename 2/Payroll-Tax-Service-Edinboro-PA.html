<p>The "point of sale" in any retail store, restaurant, grocery store, and so on refers to the location where transactions typically occur (i.e. check-out). But just because you have someone on the phone doesn't mean your system is back online; you're still losing revenue every time an impatient customer walks out of the store. All function essentially as sales and cash management tools, but each has features that are unique. In essence, they are built to help you with inventory management, order management, customer management, table management, credit card processing, menu management, employee management, and remote real-time tracking of all the KPIs plus cash flow.</p>
<p>More than simply a way to take orders and ring up sales, a POS system gives you total control over every important operational aspect of your restaurant. This POS system gives the owner features like inventory and sales tracking, monitoring products, and menu items, and generating reports. Today we're using Retail Pro in 350 stores worldwide. They can handle numerous kinds of payments and communicate well with back-end accounting software.</p>

As much as customer engagement strategy differs between brands, one thing is consistent across the board: the POS is still the one thing that never fails to bring sales associate and customer together.</p>
