These can help you to improve staff performance and increase guest retention, or even predict popular dishes and identify VIP customers. Having a specialized POS for bars makes it easy for customers to calculate a tip. Inventory control in a POS system helps you identify all patterns for ingredient usage over a selected time frame. So, whether you're replacing your current POS system or buying a new one altogether, here's what you should consider as well as a bit of inspiration from fellow small businesses.</p>
