<p>Retailers need to consider the negative consequences of failing to have a POS in place. According to the State of Small Business report, an incredible 46% of small businesses don't track their inventory or use a manual process to do so.

<p>Online ordering — Customers love having the ability to order food online, so it makes sense to get in on the action. The machine or system used by the restaurant to take your payment is termed their point of sale terminal. A POS app with a slick interface that helps your bartenders and waiters serve customers faster. Advanced Analytics: This restaurant software provides a user-friendly dashboard to manage all your outlet sales and get daily business reports.</p>
<p>As the sales of gift cards is increasing every year, your POS system must have the capability to manage those as well. Inventory Management : Restaurant POS software makes inventory management easier and more accurate. A multiple point of sale system used by big retailers like supermarkets and department stores has a far more demanding database and software architecture than that of a single station seen in small retail outlets.</p>
