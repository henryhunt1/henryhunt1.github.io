<p>POS systems come with a wide variety of features and add-ons. One thing you should note though- while you comfortable adopt it in a single-location business, TouchBistro's POS system is predominantly ideal for restaurant businesses with multiple locations.

<p>Insist on a POS system that can track sales by department, item, and hour so that you can adjust staffing hours accordingly and allocate floor space more efficiently.
