Not all POS software has this option and Managers will thank you for this.

The small retailers need a tablet, card reader, and cash box, while the more extensive operation prefers terminals, receipt printers, and barcode scanners. Other major functions include tracking for customer management and staff performance. After going through several bar POS systems reviews, we found users love TouchBistro because it is fast and easily customizable.</p>
<p>This is only possible with a faster system of product delivery to the customers. A proper POS system can streamline your retail outlet & saves time, a flawed one can complicate even the little things, thus making the process of checkout frustrating for anyone at the payment counter. It is a good idea to talk to your employees and your customers to get feedback on what kinds of features would help. Not all Point of Sale (POS) solutions are the same, and each business needs slightly different features when choosing a POS machine.</p>

To calculate the amount owed by a customer, the merchant may use various devices such as weighing scales , barcode scanners, and cash registers To make a payment, payment terminals , touch screens, and other hardware and software options are available.</p>
<p>It is hard to find a mechanical cash register today; the majority of POS systems are electronic, meaning they use an electronic cash register or computer system. When customers call a restaurant to order take-out or delivery, they want the experience to be as quick and painless as possible — from phone call to receipt of their order. All reports about the bills, orders, sales, customers, etc. Increase sales and profit, by serving your customers faster and avoid common mistakes that happen in the point of sale checkout lane.</p>

Plus through out the day it will adjust the inventory that the store holds and take away the amount every time a particular item is sold. Square for Retail narrows the product's scope a bit, simplifying some aspects of the POS software while beefing up its inventory.</p>
<p>I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc. This way, you'll have happy customers increase your restaurant's popularity. At the same time, a good POS system will allow you to accept cash, credit, and contactless payments and some will even let you accept online payments for your products and services.</p>
<p>It helps you manage restaurants, Mini Bar, Spa, Travel desk and many more. Square provides feedback through intelligent reports and analytics, giving you insights on your operations and a real-time situation on your sales, customers, and more.
