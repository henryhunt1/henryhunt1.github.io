<p>Over the last few years, there have been several advancements in restaurant POS Before we look at how the restaurant point of sale system has evolved over the years, let us first define what exactly is a point of sale system. With any one of these best restaurant management system, a restaurant or any other food-serving establishment is sure to see a marked increase in its efficiency and productivity. Whether you need several POS hardware workstations, a single mobile POS, or multiple mobile devices, Brink software can adapt to your specific restaurant size and point of sale needs.</p>
<p>With the launch of mobile payment particularly Android Pay and Apple Pay both in 2015, it is expected that because of its greater convenience coupled with good security features, this would eventually eclipse other types of payment services - including the use of payment terminals.

<p>I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc. This way, you'll have happy customers increase your restaurant's popularity.
