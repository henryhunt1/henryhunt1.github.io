<p>The core of hospitality or retail business, for that matter any trade, is the cash register. After all, with customers increasingly expecting the latest and greatest tech, you don't want to be known as the bar that delivers a poor experience with dated equipment. This will include hardware components like credit card readers, touchscreen monitors, receipt printers, and barcode scanners. The key to servicing such a wide variety of retailers is our commitment to work with you directly to customize a system to meet your unique business needs.</p>
<p>Our Restaurant Software are distributed on Cloud so data retrieval is real time. As the next-generation point-of-sale system, with cloud-based service, SaaS architecture, and bid data analysis, we help customers to achieve marketing, operations, management and all-round development of smart restaurants. When we started, we used to write all of our sales on a piece of paper, but soon we realised that we needed an efficient POS to automate our work.</p>
<p>With the launch of mobile payment particularly Android Pay and Apple Pay both in 2015, it is expected that because of its greater convenience coupled with good security features, this would eventually eclipse other types of payment services - including the use of payment terminals.
