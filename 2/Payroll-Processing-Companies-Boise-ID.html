It doesn't have its own integrated payroll processing app like Wave does, and it's not a true double-entry accounting like Sunrise is. Wave also lacks Intuit QuickBooks Self-Employed's real-time mileage tracker, and it doesn't automate as many processes as other tools do.">

<p>The early days of using a cash register and pen and notebook for accounting and processing transactions are no longer an effective means of keeping up with today's advancements in business technology. On the subject of transactions, Vend gives your customers the option of putting their favorite items on layaway or to pay for their goods via a split payment or credit they've accumulated on their customer account. Flexibility - At this point, many POS transactions are card-based, not cash-based. All in all, offering NFC, EMV, and magstripe payments guarantees you will be able to accommodate your customers no matter their payment method.</p>
