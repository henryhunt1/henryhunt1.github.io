The company says that its POS system has more than 200 features, including table management, kitchen processes, dashboard reports and a built-in CRM. However, it lacks several features, such as mobile solutions, which modern businesses will look for.</p>
<p>Features- The user should make sure that the POS system should have the core functionalities of inventory tracking, customer management, invoicing and billing, refunds and returns, employee scheduling, and data analytics. Run a Smart Cash Register, Manage Inventory, Create Customer Accounts and more. It also has a user-friendly mobile app, Revel Insights, which allows for sales analysis in real-time.

<p>There's a reason the TouchBistro app is one of the most well-used and well-loved restaurant iPad POS systems for service workers: Its support team, cost-efficiency, and raft of features are among the best around. Using a POS tool with a built-in loyalty program, you can create gift cards, punch cards, or any other loyalty program quickly and easily to ensure customers keep coming back and spending more. High-growth merchants need scalable inventory and order management solutions to streamline complex operations to help bring the focus back to selling and growing the business.</p>
<p>Manage the tables across your restaurant to monitor which tables are occupied, which are not and how many customers are seated at each table. If you are planning a very small operation, such as bagel or sandwich shop, you may not need a POS system at the opening time, especially if you aren't going to take credit cards (and there are plenty of places that still don't accept plastic). With this feature, if your business receives a reminder to refill a stock of inventory, you'll simply have to press a few buttons within your POS to do so. Keep in mind that first you'll have to onboard your vendors into your POS system.</p>
<p>Other advantages include the ability to implement various types of discounts, a loyalty scheme for customers, and more efficient stock control, and these features are typical of almost all modern ePOS systems. EPOS is a comprehensive point of sale system for the hospitality and retail industries The POS is available on mobile iOS and Android devices, as well as PCs and Macs. Inventory Efficiency: The POS system allows you to view sales reports immediately.</p>
<p>Manage staffing needs, menus, marketing campaigns, inventories proactively. If you own a store or shop of any genre, it is virtually impossible in today's competitive business world to survive without having a point of sales system in your cash terminal. To get the best deal on your retail POS system, look for companies that offer month-to-month contracts and open-source POS hardware. Unfortunately, however, the easy-to-use software layout does not provide the advanced tools you'd need to manage a full-service restaurant.</p>

In fact it is safe to say that today's retail businesses would take a sizeable step back if contemporary point of sales technology were to be suddenly taken away from them. It saves time and money and increases customer retention that's why it requires a reliable POS software for a smooth business process. Revel is best suited for established businesses that plan to stick with a single POS service provider for an extended period.</p>
<p>Instead of using traditional punch cards, you can now track your customer loyalty incentives using the POS system. Before the POS was introduced, businesses used old-school cash tills or registers to manually process transactions. A point of sale (POS) is a place where a customer executes the payment for goods or services and where sales taxes may become payable. It is also seen as the preferred deployment method of many businesses owing to the low price tags that come with cloud-based tools And then there is the projected increase in the use of self-service kiosks, not only by restaurants but among retailers as well.</p>
