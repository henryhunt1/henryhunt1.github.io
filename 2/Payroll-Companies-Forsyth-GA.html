<p>Choosing a Point of Sale System is not a simple task. Although improving the ergonomics is possible, a clean, fast-paced look may come at the expense of sacrificing functions that are often wanted by end-users such as discounts, access to commission earned screens, membership and loyalty schemes can involve looking at a different function of the POS to ensure the point of sale screen contains only what a cashier needs at their disposal to serve customers.</p>
<p>IVend POS also helps combat in-store fraud by assigning access rights per salesperson with security, Biometric login, as well as to management of data access restrictions with password, and automatic alerts on suspicious behaviors. Most restaurant POS solutions have reporting features built-in to monitor your transactions by date, time, and type. With lack of access to processed business information, retailers earlier operated on demand forecasts based on intuitions and gut feelings.</p>
<p>For multi-channel retailers who sell online and in physical spaces, applications like Shopify POS and Vend meet the above criteria. Hence it is important to keep a credit card terminal in any retail store or restaurant. Built by an industry expert, Upserve is a POS system with everything needed for restaurant, nightclub, bar, or café management. Smaller retailers are moving away from these traditional POS systems and toward cloud based point of sale solutions.</p>
