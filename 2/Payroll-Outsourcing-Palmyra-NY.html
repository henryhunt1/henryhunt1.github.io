This is ideal for restaurants where customers order at the counter, freeing up cashiers to help prepare orders faster.

If you go with a restaurant POS vendor that doesn't offer installation and training, it'll be on you to both install and train your staff.</p>
<p>Set up custom buttons to accept cash, checks, gift cards or any payment type you want.
