<p>When you are just getting started with a new retail business and are wondering whether you should install one or more retail POS software and retail POS hardware, then in this article we will discuss three distinct advantages of retail point of sale, POS, solution over the usual cash register solution. It has never been easier to take advantage of the benefits of a point of sale (POS) system designed for restaurants.

There are hundreds of different POS systems on the market, with the most popular being Mobile and iPad POS.</p>
<p>If you are already using a payment-processing service and want to stick with it, then you will want to look at POS systems which work with that system (usually called "integrated processing" since the outside company's payments are integrated into the POS). You want your POS system to be able to handle every method you might need including debit and credit cards, checks, and cash. Other Square features allow restaurants to send invoices, manage payroll and integrate with third-party applications such as QuickBooks, Xero and TaxJar.</p>
