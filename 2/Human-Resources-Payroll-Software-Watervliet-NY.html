<p>Now the last thing I want is for this be a shameless promotion of the software we develop. One of the first microprocessor-controlled cash register systems was built by William Brobeck and Associates in 1974, for McDonald's Restaurants 4 It used the Intel 8008 , a very early microprocessor (and forerunner to the Intel 8088 processor used in the original IBM Personal Computer ). Each station in the restaurant had its own device which displayed the entire order for a customer — for example, 2 Vanilla Shake, 1 Large Fries, 3 BigMac — using numeric keys and a button for every menu item.</p>
<p>If you would like to do business in-person and online, some systems will give you the ability to create an online store that will pull items from an inventory database that is exactly the same as your physical store. Used in most storefront businesses, a computer terminal combined with the POS software helps to manage everyday sales transactions and operations. This is a good pick for a quick-service or mid-size restaurant that wants tableside iPad service wrapped into a high-quality POS service.</p>
<p>In-store customers account for 50% of all eCommerce activity, research by Salesforce found, so closing the online-offline gap is critical for customer experience. POS Nation is an all-in-one Point of Sale (POS) system built to the specific needs of restaurants, retailers, and specialty stores like pizzerias, tobacco shops, liquor stores, and specialty groceries. The POS provider should be able to offer warranty, provide excellent technical support, references, full assistance with integrating the retail POS software to your business, and have the latest features and up-to-date software.</p>

<p>Apt for - ticket sales, large retail stores, parking, human resources. OPUS automatically updates the sale and stock of the POS back to the retail ERP running at the head office. More established businesses can take advantage of advanced features such as kitchen display systems, digital menu boards, online ordering and self-ordering kiosks. If you're using Quickbooks, for example, your bar point of sale software should allow you to integrate your sales data into your established Quickbooks reports.</p>
<p>Perhaps a retail store uses touch technology when they check out a customer at the department store. The business owners only have to download an app and create an account for a mobile POS system. Managing inventory in a retail business is very challenging because the stock is always in flux and the demand of items keeps shifting. The software has become a staple for many small businesses requiring a fully functional POS that does not break the bank.</p>
