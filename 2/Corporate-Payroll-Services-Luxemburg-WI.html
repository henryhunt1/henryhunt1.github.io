The good news is you can always find a different restaurant POS solution, either as a standalone product, or bundled within a larger venue management kit with multiple attractive functionalities. The ETP Omni-channel Store provides your customers a seamless experience across all your stores, e-commerce sites and other touch points. We are hardware retailers who could not find a POS solution that completely met our needs, so we developed it ourselves.</p>
<p>Different types of restaurants have different software needs, so when choosing your POS system you must first start by considering the type of food service you are running and then matching it up with the system that will be most productive for you and your business. As you can see, there are many options and features to consider when it comes to retail POS technology. With an integration to your onsite property management system from the POS, you can charge restaurant checks directly to the room for billing.</p>
<p>There are hundreds of POS companies available online, and the cost and prices will vary depending on the type of business environment you have and how many terminals you will need. Most POS systems have integrations with other technologies, like accounting, inventory management, your website CMS, staff management, and marketing. Smartphone POS services can process payments and manage some inventory and customer information.</p>
