<p>Trying to manage and grow a restaurant using old, antiquated processes like hand written order slips is a huge waste of time and energy. Hike is a leading retail POS software in the cloud with everything you need to run & grow your business. Effectively communicate with customers and increase your sales with strategically targeted promotional emails. Keep in mind that, if you are going to be accepting credit and debit cards (and most businesses must), you're going to need a service that can process those payments. You can slice and dice sales data in a variety of ways to determine what products are selling best at what time, and to figure out everything from the optimal ways to arrange shelves and displays to what promotions are working best and when to change seasonal promotions.</p>
<p>This user-friendly tool is free and enables businesses to accept and process payments both in-store and even on-the-go, for both iOS or Android gadgets. Generally, if your business has annual sales of $500k or more, you can achieve considerable savings and benefits from a POS system.
