<p>All retail businesses need to use cash registers but more and more high street shops and stores are now turning away from the traditional designs and are switching to POS or, to give them their full name, Point Of Sale machines. We are offering this all-in-one restaurant system which includes the pos, printer, cash drawer, pole display and also barcode scanner together with jRestaurant POS. For merchants, unattended POS systems offer an effective strategy for managing rising labor costs, as they allow one cashier to monitor customers using multiple self-serve POS kiosks instead of ringing up orders at a single station. These systems are best suited for small businesses and entrepreneurs, small retail stores, pop-up shops, and quick-serve establishments.</p>
<p>Many times the systems were confusing, and this meant increased hours spent training staff members on the functionality of the systems. Tracking sales by items, department, and hours, plus costs for food, labor, and other expenses are some important KPIs needed. The Zebra Scanner DS2208 is a two-dimensional barcode scanner that is widely used by retail stores for scanning product barcodes, electronic coupons, and even membership cards.</p>
<p>Pet stores benefit from the ability to track individual pets in inventory as well as make customer notes pertaining to pets in the system. Reports provide customer counts, sales information, and cost and historical data, on-site and remotely. Create a POS to suit your business - build your setup with sleek, cutting-edge hardware and accessories. Mink Foodiee Master control helps you keep a track of all your restaurants and manage them from one Central POS.</p>
