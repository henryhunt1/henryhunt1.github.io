<p>Point of sale equipment (POS) may vary from business to business. These can help you to improve staff performance and increase guest retention, or even predict popular dishes and identify VIP customers. Having a specialized POS for bars makes it easy for customers to calculate a tip. Inventory control in a POS system helps you identify all patterns for ingredient usage over a selected time frame.

SalesVu POS takes a different approach to most POS providers. Such a capability will ensure that the bar menu updates in real-time and in accordance with inventory changes.</p>
