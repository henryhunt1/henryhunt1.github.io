<p>Point of sale equipment (POS) may vary from business to business. These can help you to improve staff performance and increase guest retention, or even predict popular dishes and identify VIP customers. Having a specialized POS for bars makes it easy for customers to calculate a tip. Inventory control in a POS system helps you identify all patterns for ingredient usage over a selected time frame. So, whether you're replacing your current POS system or buying a new one altogether, here's what you should consider as well as a bit of inspiration from fellow small businesses.</p>

It may also need to be integrated with property management software.</p>

Another helpful option is setting up a few kiosks in your large retail store for your customers to look up pricing and product availability.
