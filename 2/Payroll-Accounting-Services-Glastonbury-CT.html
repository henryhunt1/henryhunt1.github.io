<p>All retail businesses need to use cash registers but more and more high street shops and stores are now turning away from the traditional designs and are switching to POS or, to give them their full name, Point Of Sale machines. We are offering this all-in-one restaurant system which includes the pos, printer, cash drawer, pole display and also barcode scanner together with jRestaurant POS. For merchants, unattended POS systems offer an effective strategy for managing rising labor costs, as they allow one cashier to monitor customers using multiple self-serve POS kiosks instead of ringing up orders at a single station. These systems are best suited for small businesses and entrepreneurs, small retail stores, pop-up shops, and quick-serve establishments.</p>

Yet, because the CRM database is integrated with the POS software, the information stored in the database is even more valuable.</p>
<p>One PayPal account for online and in store helps streamline your business operations—and you also have access to a diverse suite of other products and solutions.

Another advantage associated with Point of Sale software for restaurants is its real-time integration with inventory management.

Using handheld POS systems, employees can quickly and effortlessly accept orders, process payments, and complete transactions all while interacting with their guests.
